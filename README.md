# Draw A Scientist - webDAST
- Made at Blueprint 2021 with collaborators
- webDAST is a project that allows researchers to acquire a better knowledge of the stereotypes existent of Scientists based on certain information (Age, Location, Ethnicity, Degree of Education). Users of all ages draw a scientist. This drawing is later combined with some information provided by the artist so as to allow researchers to classify and analyze it. We hope to expand this concept to other fields as well! Engineers, Astronauts, and even Chefs could be future possibilities.
